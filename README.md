# Marketing Mix Model:

ðŸ¤“ **Project:**    Final project week Le Wagon data science bootcamp.
##
ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:**       Analyzing e-commerce shop sales and its marketing data. Data analyse and implemention of statistical modeling to improve marketing efficiency.
##
ðŸš¨ **Conclusion:** Need more data to have higher model accuracy in order to predict shop sales and get better model fit (R2= 0.4). Due to this low accuracy we switched to predicting link clicks (direct response from digital ads) which gave us higher model accuracy (R2= 0.88).

## Task Overview:

- EDA to identify trends, correlations with shop data like low sales days on Friday and Saturday.
- We looked at digital marketing spend which was the majority of the marketing activity for this company. Platforms Google, Facebook, TikTok.
- Models used: CVXPY (Mathematical solver for budget split recommendation)
- We implemented data transformers in our model like deminishing return for marketing spend.
- Predicting amount of clicks based on marketing spend input.
- Returning optimal budget split generating highest amount of clicks.
- Connecting data to Google Cloud Services and online API for displaying final results.

## Final result:

- Displaying EDA results, making click prediction, give budget split recommendation.
